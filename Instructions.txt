 1) The config file for NoPwnage is called "config.yml", you can find it
    after the first time you run the tool in the folder "plugins/NoPwnage" of
    your Bukkit directory.

 2) Never change the amount of white-spaces in front of options in the config 
    file "config.yml". It will break the configuration.

 NoPwnage will assign each message of each player a certain "suspicion" value,
 based on numerous properties, circumstances etc.

 If a message of a player reaches a specific suspicion level, the player may
 get warned to change his behaviour. If he reaches an even higher suspicion
 level, he will get banned (by default) or otherwise handled, depending on the
 config file.

 In addition to that, players that rejoin the game after leaving it really fast
 will also be subjected to warnings and finally penalties.

 You have control about how much suspicion each property of the message will
 "earn". For most properties you have the option:

 - enabled: should this property be considered at all

 - weight:  how much suspicion is given for full-filling the conditions

 - timeout: how much time in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second) has to pass before
            this property becomes reset/ignored (depends on the property).

  NoPwnage allows you to give players special permissions to e.g. bypass the
  checks or to administrate the plugin.

   nopwnage.admin:
     The player can use the "nopwnage" command to switch the plugin on/off

   nopwnage.spam:
     The player will be ignored by the spam checking part of NoPwnage. Only
     give this to trusted users and NOT to new users that didn't visit your
     server before.

   nopwnage.login:
     The player will be ignored by the "relog" checking part of NoPwnage. Only
     give this to trusted users and NOT to new users that didn't visit your
     server before.

  NoPwnage currently only has one command.

   "/nopwnage" (in chat) or "nopwnage" (in console)

     Toggle NoPwnage on/off

 Here you'll find the whole list of settings that you can manipulate in the 
 config.yml file. It is further split into logical sections

  warnPlayers:
    Should a player that reaches the "warnLevel" get a text message telling
    him that he is under suspicion of being a bot.

  warnOthers:
    Should all players get warned when a player gets banned for spambot-like 
    activity?

  warnLevel:
    How much suspicion must a message earn to issue a warning for the player

  warnTimeout:
    After what time (in ms) should a player be considered "unwarned" again.

  banLevel:
    How much suspicion must a message earn to execute the "commands" (usually
    ban the player). If warnings for players are enabled and the player hasn't
    been warned yet, he'll get warned instead.

  move.enabled:
  move.weightbonus:
  move.weightmalus:
  move.timeout:
    NoPwnage will check if a player moved within the "timeout" timeframe. If
    he did move, the suspicion will be reduced by the "weightbonus" value. If 
    he did not move, the suspicion will be increased by "weightmalus" value.
    Only used if "enabled".

  messageRepeat.enabled:
  messageRepeat.weight:
  messageRepeat.timeout:
    NoPwnage will check if a player repeats his messages within the "timeout" 
    timeframe. Even if the message is a bit different, it will be counted as
    being a repetition. The suspicion is increased by "weight" and for each
    additional repetition by "weight/2". This means that multiple repetitions
    will increase suspicion, but not as much as the first repetition.
    Only used if "enabled".

  messageSpeed.enabled:
  messageSpeed.weight:
  messageSpeed.timeout:
    NoPwnage will check if a player sends messages too fast. If a message is
    sent within "timout" ms after the previous message, increase suspicion by
    "weight". For each additional message that is sent within "timeout",
    the suspicion is increased by "weight/2". This means that multiple 
    too fast sent messages in a row will increase suspicion, but not as much as
    the first.
    Only used if "enabled".

  messageFirst.enabled:
  messageFirst.weight:
  messageFirst.timeout:
    NoPwnage will check if a player sends his first message within "timeout"
    ms after his login. If he does, increase supspicion by "weight".
    Only used if "enabled".

  globalMessageRepeat.enabled:
  globalMessageRepeat.weight:
  globalMessageRepeat.timeout:
    NoPwnage will check if a player repeats a message that has been sent by
    another player just before, within "timeout". If he does, suspicion will
    be increased by "weight" and for each additional repetition by "weight/2",
    independent of by which player. This means that multiple repetitions will
    increase suspicion, but not as much as the first repetition.
    Only used if "enabled".

  bannedMessageRepeat.enabled:
  bannedMessageRepeat.weight:
  bannedMessageRepeat.timeout:
    NoPwnage will remember the last message that caused someone to get banned.
    If a player repeats that message within "timeout" ms, the suspicion will
    be increased by "weight".
    Only used if "enabled".

  relog.enabled:
  relog.time:
  relog.warnings:
  relog.timeout:
    NoPwnage will remember the time when a player leaves the server. If he
    returns within "time" ms, he will get warned. If he has been warned
    "warnings" times already, the "commands" will be executed for him. Warnings
    get removed if the time of the last warning was more than "timeout" ms ago.

  commands:
    NoPwnage allows you to decide what should happen when a player reaches
    "banLevel" or relogged too fast. The default is to kick him and ban IP and
    name. You'll also get a log message to console stating how exactly he
    reached the "banLevel" (how much suspicion was added by each check).
    
    Commands have to be seperated by ";" and the "[player]" and "[ip]"
    wildcards will be replaced by the actual data during execution.
    
  captcha.enabled:
    Should players that get to "banlevel" be presented with a captcha first
    instead of running the commands immediatly?

  captcha.question:
    How should the question be worded. Use & to create colors. The text
    [captcha] will be replaced with the actual captcha.
 
  tries:
    How many attempts will a player have to give the correct answer. A failed
    attempt will display the question again. Be generous here, as players may
    not be fast enough to read the question the first few times or be otherwise
    distracted.

  length:
    How many characters should the captcha have.

  characters:
    The characters for the captcha are randomly drawn from this string

- NoPwnage isn't one of my "main" plugins and I don't plan on giving too much
  support for it. It's open source though, so I encourage you to modify and
  adapt it to your specific needs instead of just using it as is.

- NoPwnage draws inspiration and ideas heavily from the discontinued
  "AntiPwnage" plugin, but it doesn't take code from it that isn't already
  free to use (e.g. the used string comparison algorithm) or too simple to be
  copyright protected (single chat messages, some variable names). 
  Therefore I don't need any permission to release this plugin as is, 
  under MIT license.
  
- I appreciate DONATIONS very much. If you have some spare money and want to
  help me out financially, head over to the BukkitDev page:
  
          **** http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/nopwnage/ ****
  
  and use the "donation" button there. Alternatively contact me directly at
  wilfried.pasquazzo@gmail.com for other means of donations.
  
Thank you for reading this file.
